# Naura Nasa International Space Apps Challenge 2023 ðŸŒŒ

**Nuara** is a meticulously crafted video game tailored for individuals aged 12 and up. Our aim? To ignite a fervent passion for astronomy, astrophysics, and the boundless cosmic explorations.

> _"In this game, you're not just a player. You're the trailblazer, venturing into uncharted territories and unraveling the universe's mysteries. Let's go!"_

## Summary ðŸ“œ
Life is too precious and since ancient times, humans have gazed up at the sky. Mesmerized by the stars and wondering about the secrets they hold. But what if we could not only observe these stars but also create worlds that orbit around them? With this in mind, we undertook the challenge of Habitable Exoplanets "Creating Worlds Beyond Our Own".

For this reason, we've developed an interactive and guided learning video game that showcases the designed exoplanet, Nuara. Inspired by NASA scientific data and with flashes of creativity. Nuara orbits in the habitable zone around the star XibalbÃ¡, a K-dwarf, ideal for hosting life. 

What makes Nuara special is not only its position or size, but its atmosphere, rich in B-type chlorophyll, and its fascinating topography, with significant oceanic masses, reddish rocky landscapes and vast green areas, where life has flourished in ways we can barely imagine.

In addition, by exploring this world, a 3D modeling of the habitability of the exoplanet was made, showing the possibilities of life. In this sense, not only do we learn about the implications of exoplanets, but we learn about ourselves, about the ability to adapt, innovate and, above all, about the goal of dreaming for new worlds. The stories that could be told, the lessons that could be learned and the wonders to be discovered are extraordinary. Nuara is not just an exoplanet; it is a mirror, reflecting all the myriad possibilities the universe has to offer.

As a team, through this project, we aspire to be the next wave of scientists, explorers, and dreamers, propelling the vision that when we look up at the stars, we see them not just as distant dots in the sky but as destinations, awaiting our discovery.
