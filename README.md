# Nuara  Nasa International Space Apps Challenge 2023 üåå

**Nuara** is a meticulously crafted video game tailored for individuals aged 12 and up. Our aim? To ignite a fervent passion for astronomy, astrophysics, and the boundless cosmic explorations.

> _"In this game, you're not just a player. You're the trailblazer, venturing into uncharted territories and unraveling the universe's mysteries. Let's go!"_

## Summary üìú
Life is too precious and since ancient times, humans have gazed up at the sky. Mesmerized by the stars and wondering about the secrets they hold. But what if we could not only observe these stars but also create worlds that orbit around them? With this in mind, we undertook the challenge of Habitable Exoplanets "Creating Worlds Beyond Our Own".

For this reason, we've developed an interactive and guided learning video game that showcases the designed exoplanet, Nuara. Inspired by NASA scientific data and with flashes of creativity. Nuara orbits in the habitable zone around the star Xibalb√°, a K-dwarf, ideal for hosting life. 

What makes Nuara special is not only its position or size, but its atmosphere, rich in B-type chlorophyll, and its fascinating topography, with significant oceanic masses, reddish rocky landscapes and vast green areas, where life has flourished in ways we can barely imagine.

In addition, by exploring this world, a 3D modeling of the habitability of the exoplanet was made, showing the possibilities of life. In this sense, not only do we learn about the implications of exoplanets, but we learn about ourselves, about the ability to adapt, innovate and, above all, about the goal of dreaming for new worlds. The stories that could be told, the lessons that could be learned and the wonders to be discovered are extraordinary. Nuara is not just an exoplanet; it is a mirror, reflecting all the myriad possibilities the universe has to offer.

As a team, through this project, we aspire to be the next wave of scientists, explorers, and dreamers, propelling the vision that when we look up at the stars, we see them not just as distant dots in the sky but as destinations, awaiting our discovery.

## Life in Nuara üë©‚ÄçüöÄüë®‚ÄçüöÄ
Nuara, an astral exoplanet in the Andromeda Galaxy, has captivated the imagination of interstellar explorers. A mere 2.5 light-years away from our home, this exoplanet promises a glimpse into an alternate reality of what life could be beyond our own blue planet. But what would life truly be like on Nuara? Let's embark on a journey of discovery.
The first sensation you'd feel as you step onto Nuara's surface would be the strong tug of gravity, a testament to its higher mineral concentration and dense core. This dense nature has another surprising benefit ‚Äì vast underground aquifers that have formed over billions of years. Nuara's longer days and nights, a result of its 28-hour rotation, would require some adjustment. However, it would be nothing short of mesmerizing to witness the extended sunrises and sunsets, painting the sky in hues we might never have imagined.
Water, the elixir of life, is abundant here, but not just in the form we're accustomed to. Alongside vast, Earth-like oceans, Nuara boasts enormous liquid bodies of methane or ethane. These "lakes" and "seas" not only mirror the ethereal landscapes of Saturn's moon Titan but also harbor their own unique ecosystems, teeming with life forms waiting to be studied and understood.
The planet's topography is a diverse mosaic. The rust-orange rocky regions are a result of iron silicates reacting with oxygen, while phosphates, clays, and carbonates contribute to its varied, earthy tones. Nuara's vibrant green regions are particularly intriguing. With an atmosphere rich in chlorophyll type B, the vegetation here absorbs more green light, giving flora a unique appearance unlike anything on Earth.
The climate on Nuara is as varied as its landscape. Its 30-degree axial tilt leads to pronounced seasons, dictating the rhythm of life for its inhabitants. Organisms have evolved to withstand the intense sunlight of extended days and the chilling cold of prolonged nights. The flora is robust, with thick leaves and sturdy stems, while the fauna likely comprises extremophiles, resilient creatures that thrive in Nuara's unique conditions.
Beyond its physical characteristics, what makes Nuara truly special is its age. At 6 billion years old, it offers a vast timeline for evolution, much longer than Earth's. This extended history suggests a rich tapestry of life, with complex ecosystems that have had eons to diversify and adapt.
Living on Nuara would mean adapting to its rhythms and marveling at its unique biological wonders. The auroras at its poles, akin to Earth's Northern Lights, would be a spectacle to behold, a dance of lights illuminating the sky. And while the planet's mysteries would provide endless fascination, the robust magnetosphere ensures protection from harmful solar radiation, making it a safe haven for life.
In essence, life on Nuara would be both familiar and alien. Its landscapes might remind us of Earth's varied terrains, but its biological and atmospheric nuances would be a constant source of wonder. Nuara stands as a testament to the universe's boundless creativity, offering a world where the familiar meets the fantastic. It beckons us, inviting us to dream, explore, and, most importantly, to discover. For in Nuara, we see not just another planet, but a mirror reflecting the myriad possibilities that the universe has in store.

## Exoplanet: NUARA üå†
The lush greens and deep blues suggest vast expanses of liquid water and thriving vegetation on the planet. In astrobiology, the presence of liquid water stands as a paramount indicator for potential life. Meanwhile, the rich oranges and browns pinpoint arid regions, deserts teeming with iron and essential minerals. Lastly, the wisps of white signal the presence of clouds or perhaps ice formations in Nuara's higher altitudes or polar regions. These cloud patterns play a pivotal role in climate regulation, reflecting sunlight and preserving heat.

These colors offer a window into not just its geographic and geologic facets but also its potential to harbor life. This positions Nuara as a beacon of interest in the realms of astrobiology and space exploration. Supported by robust scientific data, Nuara stands as a compelling contender for extraterrestrial habitability. Such insights, while teeming with technical depth, are presented to captivate and pique the reader's intrigue, ensuring they remain enthralled with the wonders of Nuara.
