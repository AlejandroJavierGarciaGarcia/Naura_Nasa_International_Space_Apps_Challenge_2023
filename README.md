# Nuara  Nasa International Space Apps Challenge 2023 üåå

**Nuara** is a meticulously crafted video game tailored for individuals aged 12 and up. Our aim? To ignite a fervent passion for astronomy, astrophysics, and the boundless cosmic explorations.

> _"In this game, you're not just a player. You're the trailblazer, venturing into uncharted territories and unraveling the universe's mysteries. Let's go!"_

## Summary üìú
Life is too precious and since ancient times, humans have gazed up at the sky. Mesmerized by the stars and wondering about the secrets they hold. But what if we could not only observe these stars but also create worlds that orbit around them? With this in mind, we undertook the challenge of Habitable Exoplanets "Creating Worlds Beyond Our Own".

For this reason, we've developed an interactive and guided learning video game that showcases the designed exoplanet, Nuara. Inspired by NASA scientific data and with flashes of creativity. Nuara orbits in the habitable zone around the star Xibalb√°, a K-dwarf, ideal for hosting life. 

What makes Nuara special is not only its position or size, but its atmosphere, rich in B-type chlorophyll, and its fascinating topography, with significant oceanic masses, reddish rocky landscapes and vast green areas, where life has flourished in ways we can barely imagine.

In addition, by exploring this world, a 3D modeling of the habitability of the exoplanet was made, showing the possibilities of life. In this sense, not only do we learn about the implications of exoplanets, but we learn about ourselves, about the ability to adapt, innovate and, above all, about the goal of dreaming for new worlds. The stories that could be told, the lessons that could be learned and the wonders to be discovered are extraordinary. Nuara is not just an exoplanet; it is a mirror, reflecting all the myriad possibilities the universe has to offer.

As a team, through this project, we aspire to be the next wave of scientists, explorers, and dreamers, propelling the vision that when we look up at the stars, we see them not just as distant dots in the sky but as destinations, awaiting our discovery.

## Exoplanet: NUARA üå†
The lush greens and deep blues suggest vast expanses of liquid water and thriving vegetation on the planet. In astrobiology, the presence of liquid water stands as a paramount indicator for potential life. Meanwhile, the rich oranges and browns pinpoint arid regions, deserts teeming with iron and essential minerals. Lastly, the wisps of white signal the presence of clouds or perhaps ice formations in Nuara's higher altitudes or polar regions. These cloud patterns play a pivotal role in climate regulation, reflecting sunlight and preserving heat.

These colors offer a window into not just its geographic and geologic facets but also its potential to harbor life. This positions Nuara as a beacon of interest in the realms of astrobiology and space exploration. Supported by robust scientific data, Nuara stands as a compelling contender for extraterrestrial habitability. Such insights, while teeming with technical depth, are presented to captivate and pique the reader's intrigue, ensuring they remain enthralled with the wonders of Nuara.

# Project Details üå†
**Nuara encapsulates our fervor for space, our thirst for knowledge, and our hope to inspire others to dream big.**
## What's its purpose?
Nuara is a project where we've crafted a video game tailored for individuals aged 12 and up, aiming to ignite a passion for astronomy, astrophysics, and various cosmic explorations. The game's mission is to provide players with a glimpse into life on a habitable exoplanet, sparking that innate human curiosity that's led to monumental achievements, such as landing on the Moon. In this game, you're the trailblazer, venturing into uncharted territories and unraveling the universe's mysteries. Let's go!

Nuara educates users about the features making our exoplanet habitable. This interactive learning occurs through the story mode, narrating the astronaut's arrival and adventures on Nuara, accompanied by explanations from the robot guide found on the planet. Players use keyboard arrows to navigate the exoplanet's map.
